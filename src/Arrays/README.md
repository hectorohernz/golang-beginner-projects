# Arrays In Go

Create an array " a " that will hold exactly 5 ints

var a [5] int

By default an array is zero-valued. 

We can set a value at an index using the 

array[index] = value


We can get the length of an array by using the len() function 

len(a)


Declare and initialize an array in one line.

b:=[4]{1,2,3,4}

Arrays types are one-dimensional, but you can compose types to build multi-dimensional data structures.

var twoD [2][3]int
